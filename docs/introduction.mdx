# Chronologue: Memory-Driven Scheduling and Calendar API

## Project Overview

Chronologue is a memory orchestration platform that bridges structured memory traces with real-world calendar systems.

Designed to support both human workflows and AI-driven agent scheduling, Chronologue enables conversational histories, user goals, observations, and planned actions to be serialized, validated, and integrated into standard `.ics` formats for synchronization with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other platforms.

The system emphasizes **local-first design**, modular validation, and flexible editing to support reliable, transparent memory-driven workflows.

## Core Components

- **Memory Trace Ingestion**  
  Structured memory traces (`.json`) capturing tasks, reflections, goals, or events are submitted via a standardized API.

- **Validation Layer**  
  Traces are validated against a strict schema for compatibility with RFC 5545 calendar event standards.

- **ICS Generation Engine**  
  Converts memory traces to `.ics` format, including timestamps, UIDs, summaries, descriptions, and optional metadata.

- **Editing and Previewing**  
  Events can be reviewed or edited with Markdown previews before syncing.

- **Calendar Synchronization Modules**  
  - Google Calendar (via OAuth2)
  - Apple Calendar (`.ics` export or native integration)

- **Agent Compatibility**  
  Chronologue supports memory-to-action pipelines, enabling time-aware conversational agents and planners.

## Key Features

- Schema-based validation with error reporting
- UID preservation for traceability
- ISO 8601 + 24h time support
- Modular design for easy integration
- Human-readable and machine-compatible output

## Example Workflow

1. **Capture:** Submit memory trace as JSON (e.g., meeting, observation).
2. **Validate:** Ensure required fields and formatting.
3. **Transform:** Convert to `.ics` with timezone and UID handling.
4. **Preview/Edit:** Optional review in Markdown.
5. **Sync:** Push to calendar (Google, Apple, etc.)

## Design Philosophy

Chronologue is built around the principle that intelligent systems must be grounded in time. Scheduling is a memory-anchored action requiring precision, auditability, and flexibility.

Chronologue provides a clean, extensible interface for both humans and agents to generate and orchestrate structured calendar events.

## Future Extensions

- Multi-agent scheduling coordination
- Context-aware event updates
- Trace provenance and versioning
- Federated memory synchronization

## Getting Started

Documentation and developer guides are available in the `/docs/` and `/site/` directories.

To run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dr2633/chronologue.git
cd chronologue
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run site/grocery_scheduler/Home.py
```
