# Calendar Interface for Memory Traces

## Overview

This document outlines the approach for transforming structured memory traces into a calendar interface that serves as a **temporal log of prior model conversations and user context**. This approach focuses first on retrospective memory visualization, laying the foundation for future scheduling and planning.

---

## Objective

Create a system where structured memory traces (e.g., goals, observations, reflections) are:
- Mapped to calendar events using their `timestamp`
- Visualized in familiar calendar interfaces (Apple, Google, etc.)
- Used to recall past model-user interactions and insights over time

This replaces the need to first build complex scheduling infrastructure and focuses instead on creating a "contextual timeline" of memory.

---

## Core Design Decisions

### ✅ 1. Use Timestamp as Calendar Anchor
Each memory trace already contains an ISO 8601 `timestamp`. This becomes the `start` time of a calendar event. We add a default duration (e.g., 15 minutes) to define an `end`.

### ✅ 2. Support All Memory Types
Rather than limiting to `calendar_event` traces, we export **all types** (`goal`, `observation`, `reflection`) to create a rich memory timeline.

### ✅ 3. Generate Display-Ready Event Metadata
- **SUMMARY**: Includes the memory type and a snippet of the content
- **DESCRIPTION**: Includes full content, task ID, importance score, and other metadata

### ✅ 4. Default Duration
A fixed duration of 15 minutes is assigned to each trace unless overridden. This simplifies rendering and does not require forward scheduling input.

---

## Example Transformation

### Raw Trace:
```json
{
  "id": "m002",
  "type": "observation",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-07T13:45:00Z",
  "content": "Temperature in incubator #3 drifted 1.5°C above target during morning run.",
  "task_id": "wetlab_sync",
  "importance": 0.6
}

Benefits of This Approach
Low-friction: Requires no user input or event scheduling

High context: Enables time-based reflection, review, and reinforcement

Model-compatible: Easily ingested for trace-based reasoning or memory retrieval

Forward-compatible: Prepares the infrastructure for future forward-looking planning

Future Direction: Forward-Looking Scheduling
Once retrospective trace logging is stable, we can support:

Forward-looking goals and events (e.g., "type": "goal", "scheduled": true)

Model-generated plans inserted as .ics files or pushed via calendar APIs

Bidirectional interaction (e.g., editing or confirming planned tasks)

Summary
This interface offers a powerful way to ground model interactions in real time, giving users a tangible view of their evolving memory graph. It also creates a natural extension for future planning tools and intelligent scheduling.
